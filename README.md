# general-Electric-Digital-Technology-Data-Analytics-Program
This is an internship I have completed at General Electric. 
# About
In this program you will combine and visualize data to drive meaningful insights using enterprise-grade technology. You'll have work samples for both data engineering and data visualization to assist the GE Aviation team to make decisions based off real time data.

We are excited to have you participate and we hope that you come away from them with a better understanding of how GE Aviation rises to the challenge to invent the future of flight, lift people up, and bring them home safely.
